Each neuron applies a mathematical transformation to the input.\r\n3. **Output Layer**: The final layer that provides the output of the model.\r\n\r\n### Training a Neural Network\r\n\r\nThe process of training a neural network involves:\r\n\r\n- **Forward Propagation**: Passing the input data through the network to make predictions.\r\n- **Loss Calculation**: Measuring the difference between the network's predictions and the actual output.\r\n- **Backpropagation**: Adjusting the weights in the network to reduce the error.\r\n\r\n### Activation Functions\r\n\r\nActivation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn more complex patterns. Common activation functions include:\r\n\r\n- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: The most commonly used activation function, it outputs the input directly if positive, otherwise it outputs zero.\r\n- **Sigmoid**: Outputs values between 0 and 1, making it useful for binary classification tasks.\r\n\r\n## Types of Neural Networks\r\n\r\n1. **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**: The simplest type of neural network where connections do not form cycles.\r\n2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Primarily used for image and video processing tasks.\r\n3. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Designed for sequential data, such as time series or natural language processing.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nNeural networks are powerful tools that have revolutionized fields such as image recognition, speech processing, and more.
